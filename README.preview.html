<h1>misc pyutils</h1>

<p>These utils are developed out of suffering ... no more.</p>

<p>## Need to rename like this:</p>

<p>figure001.txt --- figure100.txt image001.jpg -- image100.txt just do:</p>

<pre><code> ./bulkren.py -f figure*.txt  -o image
</code></pre>

<p>## need to change "import sockets" to "import mysockets":</p>

<p>in every python file in the current dir just do:</p>

<pre><code>./chall.py "import sockets" "import mysockets" *.py
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure what to expect? Add the -t option for "test", so the program can
 show you what it would do.</p>

<h2>A nifty utility to test things.</h2>

<p>The test case file drives an send expect engine. The expect is then evaluated and
the result is printed in a green colored 'OK' or a red colored 'ERR'.</p>

<pre><code>./testdrive.py testcase.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The test case file contains the test instructions, one line per test. The format:</p>

<pre><code>#   Context_string  Send_string     Expect_string   Find/Compare
#   --------------  -----------     -------------   ------------
#    for the user   what to test    what to expect  True if Find
</code></pre>
